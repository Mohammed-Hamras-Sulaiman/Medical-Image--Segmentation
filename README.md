# Medical image segmentation using deep learning

## Overview  
Medical image segmentation is a crucial application of deep learning that enables precise identification of regions of interest in medical images such as MRI, CT, or X-ray scans. This project focuses on **lung segmentation** using deep learning models, integrated into a web-based application.  

The system consists of:  
- A **Django-based backend** for image uploads, model inference, and data management.  
- A **deep learning model** (U-Net or V-Net) to perform accurate segmentation of lung regions from medical images.  

## Features  
✅ **User Management**: Register, login, and role-based authentication.  
✅ **Medical Image Upload**: Supports MRI, CT scans, and X-rays.  
✅ **Lung Segmentation Model**: Deep learning-based inference using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.  
✅ **Segmentation Visualization**: Displays input vs. segmented output with overlays.  
✅ **Report Generation**: Provides a history dashboard and downloadable reports.  
✅ **REST API**: Enables image uploads, model inference, and retrieval of results.  

## Technologies Used  

### Frontend  
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the UI.  

### Backend  
- **Django**: Handles server-side logic and APIs.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Enables RESTful API development.  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for lung segmentation.  
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user data and image results.  
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV and Pillow for image preprocessing.  

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+**, **Git**, and **pip** installed.  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
